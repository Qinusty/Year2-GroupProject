# Buccaneer Group Project
This project was done for my Software Engineering module at Aberystwyth
University with a group of 7 other members and got us an overall mark of 82%.

The project turned out to be surprisingly fun to play and we spent quite a while fine tuning the gameplay to make it fairly easy to pick up and play. The game meets all of the requirements given to us, including to be playable on the single machine. This is unfortunate as we would have liked to have a multiplayer version of the game, but this was not a priority for us.
