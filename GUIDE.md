## The Game
### Goal
Buccaneer is a 4 player board game where the players take turns to sail around the board with a goal of collecting treasure until reaching a total value of 20 treasure.
Treasure can be obtained through 'chance' cards which are picked up from Treasure island in the center of the board, these cards can have positive or negative effects. 

### Crew Cards
Movement and combat strengths are defined by the 'crew cards' in your hand. Your movement total is defined by the total value of all of your crew cards.

Combat strength is defined by the difference of the total values of red and black crew cards.

### Ports
You can trade at all ports other than your own where you instantly deposit your treasures. Trading at ports has to be of equal value, whether it be crew cards or treasure or even chance cards.

### Combat
Combat is engaged when you sail onto another ship or you attempt to sail over another ship and they decide to attack you. The winner is the player with the highest combat strength, the winner then takes treasure from the loser until their ship is full (capacity of 2 treasures) and the loser's remaining treasure is returned to treasure island. The loser gets a free move in a direction of their choice, however they can only move, no trading or island interaction.
